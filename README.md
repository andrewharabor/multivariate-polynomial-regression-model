# Multivariate Polynomial Regression Model

## Description

This is a multivariate polynomial regression model written in Python and utilizing NumPy that I wrote after learning about the basics of Machine Learning.

## The Details

### Model Function

Traditionally, a univariate linear regression model uses the function $f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) = wx^{(i)} + b$ where $x^{(i)}$ represents the $i^{\text{th}}$ input value and $w$ and $b$ represent parameters of the model, namely the weight and bias repsectively.
